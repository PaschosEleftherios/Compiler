# Compiler
A fully functional compiler in a language called Cimple.
In the "cimple_4151.py" file we can see the the below stages:
1)Lexical Analysis
2)Symbol table construction
3)Syntax Analysis
4)Assembling code and generating a ".asm".

The compiler's code is written in just one file,because that was the way that we were told to do it.

Cimple is a language with the basic features that a common language provides.
1)Arithmetic operations
2)Logic expressions
3)Functions-Recursive functions

We pass a ".ci" file as an argument and then the magic happens.

After running the program we can see 2 new files in our repository a ".c" ,a ".asm",a ".int" file
each one of them having the C code ,the Asm code,the quads from the intermediate code respectively, from the file we gave as input to the compiler.

The average.ci file is provided on this repository, for more files to run and details about Cimple,
a brief explanation is provided inside cimpleFinalReport.pdf(for now only in Greek.)
