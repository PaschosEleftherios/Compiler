# Compiler
A fully functional compiler in language called Cimple.
In the "cimple_4151.py" file we can see the the below stages:
1)Lexical Analysis
2)Symbol table construction
3)Syntax Analysis
4)Assembling code and generating a ".asm".

The compiler's code is written in just one file,because that was the way that we were told to do it.

Cimple is a language with the basic features that a common language provides.
1)Arithmetic operations
2)Logic expressions
3)Functions-Recursive functions

We pass a ".ci" file as an argument and then the magic happens.

After running the program we can see 2 new files in our repository a ".c" and a ".asm" file
each one of them having the C code and the Asm code from the file we gave as input to the compiler.

The overall details are in cimpleFinalReport pdf (for now in Greek.)
